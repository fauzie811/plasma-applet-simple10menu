# Simple 10 Menu

A fork of Tiled Menu by Zren with the following changes:

- It aims to be much simpler with less features and less customizeable, but more similar to Windows 10's Start menu (without the tiles).
- Removed tiles functionality.
- Fixed icon sizes (16px for the sidebar, 22px for the apps list).
- Added square tiles behind the app icons.

## TODOs

- [ ] UI for customizing tile colors.
